.. currentmodule:: pydda.constraints

The procedures in this module are used to add spatial fields from non-radar
based datasets for use as a constraint. The model cost function uses the
observations inserted into the Grid object from these procedures as a
constraint. In order to develop your own custom constraint here, simply
create a function that adds 3 fields into the input Py-ART Grid with names
"u_(name)", "v_(name)", and "w_(name)" where (name) is the name of your
dataset. Then, in order to have PyDDA use this dataset as a constraint,
simply add (name) into the model_fields option of
:py:func:`get_dd_wind_field`.
