.. _gridding:

Converting the radar data to Cartesian coordinates with Py-ART
==============================================================

PyDDA expects radar data to be in Cartesian coordinates before it retrieves
the wind fields. Most radar data, however, is in the radar's native antenna
coordinates. Therefore, the radar data needs to be converted to Cartesian
coordinates. Py-ART's mapping toolbox contains the necessary utilties

We will assume that you have followed the steps outlined in :ref:`reading-radar-data`
for reading the radar data in its native coordinates.  PyDDA requires dealiased velocities
with noise, ground clutter, and second trip echoes removed for proper
wind retrieval. Therefore, make sure you have first followed the instructions in :ref:`dealiasing-velocities`
to correct the Doppler velocity data.

Gridding the data
-----------------

After the Doppler velocity data is corrected, it needs to be projected
from the radar's native antenna coordinates to Cartesian coordinates.

First, we need to determine a grid spacing that we want to use for the coordinate
system. The X-band radars have a maximum unambiguous range of 50 km, so we do
want to expand our grid to include areas 50 km away fron one of the radars

In addition, we want to be careful with our choice of grid resolution. For example,
if we choose too fine of a grid resolution, then there may not be enough radar coverage
available for making the input radial velocity fields continuous. This can cause your
retrieval to have artificial noise, especially in updraft velocity. Therefore,
you will need to choose a grid spacing that is coarse enough to have a continuous
input radial velocity field at all altitudes. For example, Kosiba et al. (2013)
chose their grid spacing such that it is about 1/2.5 the data spacing at the feature
of interest. In this example, we will elect for a 500 m grid spacing.


.. code-block:: python

    grid_limits = ((0., 15000.), (-50000., 50000.), (-50000., 50000.))
    grid_shape = (31, 201, 201)


The :code:`grid_limits` is a 3-tuple of 2-tuples specifying the :math:`z`, :math:`y`, and :math:`x`
limits of the grid in meters. The :code:`grid_shape` specifies the shape of the grid in number of
points. We then use PyART's `grid_from_radars <https://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/API/generated/pyart.map.grid_from_radars.html>`_
function to create the grids :code:`grid_sw` and :code:`grid_se`.

.. code-block:: python

    grid_sw = pyart.map.grid_from_radars([radar_sw], grid_limits=grid_limits,
                                     grid_shape=grid_shape, gatefilter=gatefilter_sw)
    grid_se = pyart.map.grid_from_radars([radar_se], grid_limits=grid_limits,
                                     grid_shape=grid_shape, gatefilter=gatefilter_se)

Finally, we should visualize the output grids using Py-ART's
`GridMapDisplay <https://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/API/generated/pyart.graph.GridMapDisplay.html>`_.

                                 ax=ax1, fig=fig, vmin=-30, vmax=30)
    ax2 = plt.subplot(212)
    display2 = pyart.graph.GridMapDisplay(grid_se)

Note that, as the spacing between the sweeps increases with
altitude that there can be gridding artifacts that can produce spurious air motion in the
retrievals (Collis et al. 2010). To reduce these artifacts it's important that the velocity
field at higher altitudes be as continuous as possible. This requires a grid resolution that
will you will need to balance with keeping important details of the feature of interest that
you are trying to grid. You may have to adjust your grid resolution to balance these two
concerns in order to properly retrieve wind velocities. With the current grid spacing,
it is apparent that there are discontinuities in the radial velocity field above 7.5 km
altitude that could cause spurious noise in the retrieved vertical velocity field.
Vertical velocities are likely to be most reliable about 20-40 km from either radar.
